This is the challenge that Nik sees:

  Challenge for Nikolai (but really anyone)

  Create a small console-based program that does the following:

Login System
  Ask the user for a username and password.
  Verify them against stored values.
  If correct, grant access. If not, deny and exit.

Main Menu
  After logging in, show a menu with multiple choices. For example:
  Show the current date and time.
  Retrieve information from the internet (like weather).
  Simulate a dice roll.
  Allow the user to update their password.
  Create a triangle pattern of a user given length.
  
User Experience
  Make sure the program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
  Each menu choice should clearly show results.
  Invalid inputs should be handled gracefully.


After you create your code, it will be added to the repo and will be compared to a private repo with my version.
I will release my version once Nikolai submits his version
